In order to bulk crop each image I used gimp and imagemagick.

I opened the image in gimp, selected the region of interest making sure my mouse was hovering in the top left of the selection. At this point I took a screenshot, simultaniously recording the box width, height and absolute position in X and Y.

Using the instructions found here:
https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/cropping-multiple-images-the-same-way-short-tutorial/

I then used mogirfy within imagemagick to crop these images. One such line of code can be seen below:

C:\Users\sbiggs\Dropbox\Documents\GitHub\Film-Dosimetry\image_sets\004_Matt_brachy_aged_2\0600>
	C:\Users\sbiggs\Downloads\ImageMagick-6.8.9-2\mogrify.exe -crop 388x44+14+38 *.png

The corresponding screenshot for that line of code can be found in this folder.
